ISSUES LIST

1) Failed at using Hash Structure:
Attempted to use hash rocket structure to collect data, but received error message.

Used array structure as fallback.

2) Failed at using Ternary operator
Attempted to use ternary operator to normalise gender:
person << parts[2].downcase.start_with?("f") 

But code returned true or false instead of "Female"/"Male"
