ISSUES LIST

1) Hash Structure:
Attempted to use hash rocket structure to collect data, but received error message.

Used array structure as fallback.

2) Ternary operator
Attempted to use ternary operator to normalise gender:
person << parts[2].downcase.start_with?("f") 

But code returned true or false instead of "Female"/"Male"

3) Writing to file
Output format did not conform to criteria.

To investigate

4) Refactoring code
NEXT STEP: To use classes and methods
